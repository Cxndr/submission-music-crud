### 🏹 Reflections
Initially had some hiccups in how to organize my code - particularly when it came to seperation of client and server components. But once I got a handle on the intended design patterns things clicked and the process was quite enjoyable, the faster development speed and centralization of code was very nice compared to last week doing just React. Being my first full NextJS app - I definitely could have made the codebase more modular to avoid duplication if I were to start again.

I also took the oppurtunity to try out using tailwind for styling. In the end I did most of my styling in tailwind but kept some cross-site styles in css files where it would drastically reduce code duplication. I didn't expect to like tailwind due to the visual noise and lack of centralization but by the end of the project found myself appreciating the speed and flexibility it offered. I still have some worries about needing code duplication but for the most part it forced me to work in a more modular pattern to avoid this as much as possible.
